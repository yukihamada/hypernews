## Outreach Template

### Subject Line Options
1. "Quick question about hunting a $64.5K mistake"
2. "Would you hunt a Rust-powered multi-site news platform?"
3. "Hunter for AI news platform (unusual story inside)"

### Email/DM Template

```
Hi [Name],

I'm launching a project on Product Hunt soon and wondered if you'd be
interested in hunting it.

THE STORY:
I accidentally spent $64,500 on premium domains (news.online, news.xyz,
etc.) without checking the price. Then built 7 different AI news sites
from a single Rust binary to justify the cost.

THE PRODUCT:
- One Rust binary → 7 unique news experiences
- news.xyz (card-based), news.online (TikTok-style), news.cloud (API)
- AI features: Claude-generated podcasts, chat, personalization
- Efficient architecture: shared backend, client-side routing
- All running from one Fly.io deployment

WHY IT MIGHT INTEREST YOU:
[Personalize based on their focus:]
- Unusual indie maker story (mistake → innovation)
- Strong technical angle (Rust, efficiency, multi-tenant)
- Multiple products in one (news + API + tools)
- Visual appeal (Apple-inspired design, smooth UX)
- AI integration (Claude + OpenAI TTS)

WHAT'S READY:
✓ 60-second demo video
✓ 10 high-quality screenshots
✓ Polished copy with the $64.5K story
✓ Live sites (all 7 domains working)
✓ API documentation
✓ Press-ready materials

LAUNCH PLAN:
Target: [Date], 12:01 AM PST
Goal: Top 5 Product of the Day
Strategy: Story-driven (hook) + tech-focused (substance) + visual (proof)

Would you be interested in hunting this? Happy to send more details,
answer questions, or jump on a quick call.

Either way, thanks for considering!

Best,
Yuki Hamada

P.S. Here's a quick preview: [news.xyz link]

## Personalized Pitches

### For Chris Messina (@chrismessina)
**Focus**: Social innovation + storytelling

```
Chris,

You've hunted some of the most innovative social/AI products. I have
one with an unusual story:

I accidentally spent $64.5K on domains. Instead of giving up, I built
7 AI news sites from a single Rust binary. Each site is a different
UX for the same content (card-based, TikTok-style, API, chat, etc.).

The interesting part: It's all client-side routing. One binary, one
database, one deployment → seven experiences. Kind of like if Twitter
had 7 different clients built-in.

Would you consider hunting it? The story + tech combo might resonate
with the PH community.

Preview: news.xyz

Thanks,
Yuki
```

### For Vlad Calus (@vladcalus)
**Focus**: News aggregation + content tools

```
Vlad,

Saw you hunted [Product X] - loved that you focus on news/content tools.

I built something in that space with a twist:

7 news sites powered by one Rust binary:
- news.xyz (card layout, 3 themes)
- news.online (TikTok-style vertical feed + AI podcasts)
- news.cloud (API for developers)
- chatnews.link (chat with AI about news)
- yournews.link (personalized curation)
- velo.tech (web performance tool)

All from the same codebase, same database, same deployment.

The backstory: I accidentally spent $64.5K on premium domains, so I
HAD to build something good 😅

Think this would resonate with the PH audience? I have video,
screenshots, and everything ready.

Let me know!
Yuki

Try it: news.online (best on mobile)
```

### For Bram Kanstein (@bramk)
**Focus**: Indie makers + unique stories

```
Bram,

Quick story: I bought domains for a news platform without checking the
price. Invoice came: $64,500.

After the panic subsided, I thought "Well, can't return them. Better
build something extraordinary."

So I did:
→ 7 AI news sites from one Rust binary
→ Shared backend, different UIs (card, TikTok-style, API, chat, etc.)
→ AI podcasts, themes, personalization
→ All running from one Fly.io deployment

It's the ultimate indie maker "make lemonade from lemons" story.

Would you be interested in hunting it on Product Hunt? I think the
maker community would appreciate the redemption arc 😅

Everything's ready (video, screenshots, copy). Just need a hunter
who gets the indie hustle.

Thanks for considering!
Yuki

P.S. news.xyz / news.online if you want to check it out

### For Samy Jalil (@samyjalil - Beams)
**Focus**: News innovation + AI

```
Samy,

You built Beams (love the AI summary approach), so you know the news
aggregation space well.

I took a different angle: instead of one perfect UI, I built 7
different ones from the same backend.

Why? I accidentally spent $64.5K on premium domains (news.xyz,
news.online, news.cloud, etc.) and had to justify it somehow 😅

The result:
- TikTok-style vertical feed (news.online)
- Card-based themes (news.xyz)
- API platform (news.cloud)
- Chat interface (chatnews.link)
- Personalization (yournews.link)

All powered by one Rust binary. Same content, different experiences.

I'm curious: as someone in the news space, would you consider hunting
this on Product Hunt? Or if not, I'd love your feedback on the
approach.

Either way, happy to chat about news product strategy!

Best,
Yuki

Try: news.online (mobile), news.cloud (API docs)

## Hunter Research Checklist

For each candidate, verify:

- [ ] Follower count (500+ minimum)
- [ ] Recent activity (hunted in last 30 days)
- [ ] Niche alignment (AI, dev tools, news, indie)
- [ ] Engagement rate (avg comments/upvotes on hunted products)
- [ ] Accessibility (Twitter, email, or PH DM open)
- [ ] Reputation (no spam, quality products only)

---

## Backup Plan (Self-Hunt)

If no hunter commits:

1. **Self-hunt as maker**: Product Hunt allows this
2. **Amplify with community**: Ask friends/followers to upvote
3. **Focus on comments**: Engage heavily in discussions
4. **Cross-promote**: Share on Twitter, HN, Reddit simultaneously
5. **Quality over hunter clout**: A good product will rise regardless

**Self-Hunt Advantages**:
- Full control over timing and messaging
- More authentic (maker-driven)
- No coordination overhead
- Can still succeed (many top products are self-hunted)

---

## Hunter Incentives (Optional)

### What Hunters Get
1. **Credit**: Listed as hunter on Product Hunt
2. **Network**: Connection to maker (you)
3. **Karma**: Points if product does well
4. **Recognition**: Featured if product hits #1

### What You Can Offer
- **Early access**: API keys, pro features
- **Thank you**: Public shoutout, blog post mention
- **Reciprocity**: Hunt their product in future
- **Gift**: Small token (Starbucks, merch, etc.)

**Note**: Don't bribe. Offer value, not payment. Product Hunt prohibits paid hunting.

---

## Communication Timeline

### Week -2
- [ ] Research hunters
- [ ] Draft personalized messages
- [ ] Prepare preview materials (video, screenshots)

### Week -1
- [ ] Send outreach to 10 hunters
- [ ] Follow up with interested parties
- [ ] Secure commitment from 1-2 hunters

### Week -0 (Launch Week)
- [ ] Confirm final details with hunter
- [ ] Send all assets (video, screenshots, copy)
- [ ] Coordinate launch timing
- [ ] Prepare to support during launch day

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

Don't work with hunters who:
- Ask for payment (violates PH rules)
- Have low engagement on previous hunts
- Hunt too frequently (spam behavior)
- Don't align with your product niche
- Are unresponsive or flaky
- Have negative reputation in community

---

## Success Metrics

A good hunter will:
- [ ] Have 500+ followers
- [ ] Have hunted 5+ products in your category
- [ ] Get 100+ upvotes per hunt (average)
- [ ] Engage in comments on their hunted products
- [ ] Be responsive to outreach (reply within 48h)
- [ ] Show genuine interest in your product

---

## Alternative: Community Launch

Instead of a single hunter, mobilize your community:

**Channels**:
1. **Twitter**: Tweet thread + ask for upvotes
2. **Indie Hackers**: Post in "Share Your Project"
3. **Reddit**: r/SideProject, r/InternetIsBeautiful
4. **Hacker News**: "Show HN: news.xyz"
5. **Dev.to**: Write a blog post about the tech
6. **LinkedIn**: Share the story with professional network

**Community Launch Advantages**:
- Broader reach (not dependent on one person)
- More authentic engagement
- Multiple traffic sources
- Builds long-term audience

---

**Remember**: A good hunter amplifies your launch, but a great product succeeds regardless. Focus on quality first, hunter second.
