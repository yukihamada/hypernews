## The Story (Your Hook)

### Short Version (1 sentence)
"I accidentally spent $64,500 on domains, so I built 7 AI news sites from one Rust binary to justify it."

### Medium Version (1 paragraph)
"I had a brilliant idea for an AI news platform and registered some domains without checking the price. Then the invoice arrived: news.online ($40,000), news.xyz ($16,000), and 5 others ($8,500). Total: $64,500. I had no idea premium domains cost this much. But instead of giving up, I built 7 completely different news experiences from a single Rust binary to justify the expense."

### Long Version (2-3 paragraphs)
"I was excited about building an AI news platform. I registered a few domains - news.xyz, news.online, news.cloud - thinking they'd be like $10-20/year. Then the invoice came: $64,500 USD. My heart stopped.

After the shock wore off, I realized I couldn't return them. So I thought: 'Well, I made an expensive mistake. Might as well build something extraordinary to justify it.'

That's how HyperNews was born. One Rust binary that powers 7 completely different news sites: card-based (news.xyz), TikTok-style (news.online), API platform (news.cloud), chat interface (chatnews.link), personalized (yournews.link), and more. All from the same codebase, same database, same deployment. No regrets."

## Social Media Posts

### Twitter/X Launch Thread

```
🧵 I accidentally spent $64,500 on domains.

Here's what I built to justify it:

(1/10)

---

The story: I had this idea for an AI news platform. Got excited and
registered some domains without checking the price.

Then the invoice arrived:
- news.online: $40,000
- news.xyz: $16,000
- 5 others: $8,500

Total: $64,500 😱

(2/10)

I had no idea premium domains cost this much. My heart stopped.

But after the panic subsided, I thought: "Well, I can't return them.
Might as well build something extraordinary."

So I did.

(3/10)

---

I built 7 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT news sites from ONE Rust binary:

🎯 news.xyz - Card layout, 3 themes, AI chat
📱 news.online - TikTok-style vertical feed + AI podcasts
🔧 news.cloud - API platform for developers
💬 chatnews.link - Chat with AI about news
✨ yournews.link - Personalized curation
⚡ velo.tech - Web performance tool

(4/10)

---

The crazy part? They all run from the SAME Docker image.

Same backend. Same database. Same deployment.

Domain detection happens client-side. UI switches based on hostname.

One deployment updates all seven sites instantly.

(5/10)

---

Tech stack:
- Rust (axum 0.7) - backend
- SQLite (WAL mode) - database
- Vanilla JS - frontend (no framework!)
- Claude Sonnet - AI dialogue generation
- OpenAI TTS - voice synthesis
- Fly.io Tokyo - hosting

Build time: ~2 minutes
Docker image: ~150MB
Performance: <50ms API response

(6/10)

---

My favorite feature: AI podcasts on news.online

Swipe through news like TikTok. Tap play → Claude generates a
2-person dialogue about the article → OpenAI TTS creates voices.

Cost: $0.007 per article. Cached for 6 hours.

Try it: https://news.online (best on mobile)

(7/10)

---

For developers: news.cloud has a REST API

GET /api/articles
GET /api/categories
POST /api/podcast/generate
POST /api/tts

Free tier available. CORS enabled. JSON responses.

Docs: https://news.cloud

(8/10)

Lessons learned:

1. ALWAYS check the price before buying domains
2. Mistakes can push you to build better things
3. One codebase, multiple UIs = efficient
4. Rust + SQLite = rock solid performance
5. No regrets (okay, maybe a few)

### Hacker News Post

**Title**: Show HN: news.xyz - I spent $64.5K on domains, so I built 7 AI news sites

**Post**:
```
I made an expensive mistake that turned into an interesting project.

Story: I got excited about an AI news platform idea and registered a
few domains (news.xyz, news.online, news.cloud, etc.) without checking
the price. Invoice came: $64,500 USD.

After the shock wore off, I built 7 different news experiences from
one Rust binary to justify the cost:

- news.xyz (card-based, 3 themes)
- news.online (TikTok-style vertical feed + AI podcasts)
- news.cloud (API platform for developers)
- chatnews.link (chat with AI about news)
- yournews.link (personalized curation)
- velo.tech (web performance tool)

All running from the same Docker image on Fly.io. Domain detection
happens client-side (JavaScript checks hostname), so one deployment
updates all sites.

Tech: Rust (axum) + SQLite (WAL) + Vanilla JS. Claude Sonnet generates
podcast dialogue, OpenAI TTS creates voices. ~150MB Docker image,
<50ms API latency.

The architecture was driven by cost optimization (after the domain
mistake, I wanted maximum efficiency). Turns out you can build
multiple premium UIs from one codebase without sacrificing UX.

Try it:
- news.xyz (desktop)
- news.online (mobile, TikTok-style)
- news.cloud (API docs)

Happy to answer questions about the tech, the story, or why I didn't
check the domain price first!

Title: I spent $64.5K on domains by accident. Built 7 AI news sites to cope.

I made a REALLY expensive mistake.

I was building an AI news platform and registered some premium domains
without checking the price. Invoice: $64,500 USD.

Instead of giving up, I built 7 different news sites from one Rust
binary:
- news.xyz (card layout)
- news.online (TikTok-style feed)
- news.cloud (API platform)
- + 4 others

All from the same codebase. One deployment. Seven experiences.

Tech: Rust + SQLite + Claude AI + OpenAI TTS

Lesson: Always check the domain price. But if you don't, build
something extraordinary to justify it.

Try it: news.xyz / news.online

```

**r/InternetIsBeautiful**:
```
Title: news.online - TikTok-style vertical news feed with AI-generated podcasts

Check out news.online (best on mobile):

- Swipe vertically through news like TikTok
- Tap play → AI generates a 2-person podcast about the article
- Apple Liquid Glass design
- Voice commands in Japanese

Also try news.xyz for a card-based layout with 3 themes.

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "This is just a rich kid flexing"
**Solution**: Emphasize it was a mistake, still paying it off, learning experience

**Issue**: "Why 7 mediocre sites instead of 1 good one?"
**Solution**: Each serves different use case, shared backend = efficient

**Issue**: "Domains aren't worth that much"
**Solution**: Show invoice (redacted), explain premium domain pricing

**Issue**: Technical questions about architecture
**Solution**: Have code examples ready, offer to write blog post

**Issue**: Low engagement on launch day
**Solution**: Cross-post to HN/Reddit immediately, activate upvote squad
