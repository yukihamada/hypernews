## 🎬 The 60-Second Pitch

> "I spent $64,500 on domains by accident. Here's what I built."

**Problem → Solution (10-25s)**:
> "One Rust binary powers 7 different news sites. Same backend, different experiences. All AI-powered."

**Demo (25-50s)**:
> Show news.xyz, news.online, news.cloud in action. Highlight TikTok-style feed, AI podcasts, API platform.

**Payoff (50-60s)**:
> "No regrets. Sometimes mistakes push us to build better things. Try it at news.xyz."
